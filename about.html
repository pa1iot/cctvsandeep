                    <p><strong>The retail industry loses billions of dollars per year to employee theft and shoplifting.
                        Investing in IP video surveillance cameras as a solution to your security needs
                        provides numerous long-term benefits such as reduced retail shrinkage, maximized
                        store profits, lowered insurance rates, and ultimately a decrease in the number of
                        theft cases. Security cameras also help instill a safer, more inviting store
                        environment for patrons.
                        With the number of technologies available on IP cameras today, it’s important to
                        determine the exact security needs of your retail store. Will you need indoor and
                        outdoor cameras for your retial security system? What are your store’s weak spots?
                        Are there any poorly lit sections of your shop? Is there an aisle or section that is
                        harder to see than other areas of your store? These are just some of the questions to
                        consider when shopping for a new retail security system</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Retail store owners are forever plagued by the threat of shoplifting and employee theft.
                            Fortunately, IP camera systems can help reduce in-store theft like organized retail crime
                            and shoplifting. Shoplifters and employees who know the store is outfitted with retail
                            security cameras will be less tempted to steal or engage in unauthorized activities. Retail
                            security cameras can also help you identify the person who committed the crime with
                            vivid, clear images that are easy to depict.</strong></p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 style="color:blue;">Shoplifting</h3>
                        <p><strong>The National Association for Shoplifting Prevention estimates that over $13 billion worth
                            of goods are shoplifted from retail stores each year. This amount equates to $35 million
                            in losses per day! If that is not enough reason to set up your retail security system now,
                            then we don't know what is! Veteran shoplifters can be difficult to catch by loss
                            prevention officers. Installing retail security cameras instead of hiring expensive security
                            officers saves you thousands of dollars per year and is considered one of the most
                            effective methods for apprehending shoplifters.</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Despite exhaustive background checks and interviews, no employer can ever be 100%
                            certain that an employee won’t steal. Playing back recorded video on your retail security
                            cameras makes it possible to spot cases of employee theft so you can terminate that

                        <p><strong>Some retail employees will give unauthorized product discounts to their friends and

                            discounted products (or sometimes free products) at the cash register. Retail store

                        </h3>
                        <p><strong>Flash robs, a relatively new class of theft, is becoming a major problem in metropolitan
                            cities. Working its way into a different city every day, flash rob theft is typically
                            committed by a large group of adolescents or young adults who raid a store to steal
                            items, all the while throwing and breaking products, yelling or making threatening
                            statements, and posing extreme danger to the staff and customers. Store owners should
                            never intervene or try to use physical force in these often violent robberies, but having
                            retail security cameras recording the incident will help law enforcement identify the
                            participants.

                        <p><strong>Large underground shoplifting rings are spread out across the United States. Ring
                            members have a reputation for casually walking into grocery and department stores,
                            grabbing high-value products like Diapers, Razors, or Detergent off of shelves and
                            stuffing them in carts or bags, and then running out of the store where they’re usually
                            picked up by a getaway driver. Store owners or security staff may not even notice these
                            professional shoplifters until they notice the missing merchandise, but retail security
                            systems can record the thieves' progress in and out of the store, giving police the chance
                            to identify and stop rings operating in the area.</strong></p>

                        <h3 style="color:blue;">Where to Place Retail Security Cameras</h3>
                        <p><strong>Entrances and Exits: Mount your retail security cameras directly above or near your
                            store’s entrance(s) and exit(s) to monitor the flow of customers and employees. This
                            location provides a clear view of each person coming in and out your storefront. With
                            high quality IP video, you can recognize and identify faces to save as evidence if needed.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Cash Register: The cash register is an extremely sensitive area and should be monitored
                            at all times. Dishonest employees will steal directly from the cash register, and as a
                            business owner with a never-ending list of responsibilities, you can’t always be there to
                            make certain that all sales for the day have been accounted for. Retail security cameras
                            should be mounted above the register to monitor and observe all activity taking place at
                            the register, including transactions, refunds, and money counting. To catch employees
                            who you suspect are sweethearting, cameras should be installed directly above the
                            scanner.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Sales Floor: Always outfit your sales floor with at least one security camera. Depending
                            on the size of your business, you may need a considerable number of security cameras
                            to cover the space. Poorly lit aisles or areas that are difficult to see should also be
                            monitored by cameras. Shoplifters tend to migrate towards store locations that lack
                            sufficient customer service or have less visibility.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Warehouse: Thieves will often seek out store warehouses to steal inventory and/or cargo.
                            Over $425 million in cargo was stolen from warehouses, loading trucks, and docks in
                            2010 according to FreightWatch International. Security cameras should be mounted up
                            on beams, drop ceilings, or main ceilings to oversee the inventory.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Parking Lot: If your store has its own parking lot, consider investing in a video
                            surveillance system to cover this specific area. Vehicle break-ins are common in store
                            parking lots for employees and customers. Installing network video cameras in your
                            parking lot makes license plate recognition possible, which is tremendously helpful in
                            cases where a perpetrator has fled the scene in his or her vehicle.

                        <h3 style="color:blue;">Benefits of Installing Retail Security Cameras</h3>
                        <p><strong>Video surveillance cameras offer several long-term benefits to you as a store owner.
                            Ultimately, the presence of video surveillance cameras helps strengthen your business.                            
                        </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Insurance Discounts: Your retail store suddenly becomes less of a liability when it is
                            outfitted with security cameras. Nationwide, Farmer’s Insurance, and State Farm are just
                            some of the many insurance providers that offer lower rates to business owners who
                            have retail security systems in place.                            
                        </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Safer Workplace: In addition to forestalling theft, surveillance cameras help build a safer
                            workplace by monitoring employees and scouring the floor for any safety hazards.
                            Slip-and-fall fraud, a crime that happens all too often in the workplace, can be recorded
                            by cameras and later viewed in the event that an employee tries to sue your company for
                            their false injuries.
                        </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Reduced Theft and Vandalism: Petty thieves are less likely to steal from your storefront if
                            they know they’re being closely monitored by multiple video surveillance cameras. Take
                            further action by placing cameras in high-theft areas like the cash register and aisles
                            where the lighting and visibility is poor.
                        </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Customer Analytics: Many video surveillance cameras come with built-in intelligence
                            such as people counting technology, queue management, loitering functionality, and
                            crowd detection. Leveraging your security camera systems’ intelligence will help you
                            sustain a thriving, successful business.                            
                        </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Remote Access: By switching to network video, you’ll have remote access to your
                            camera system. The competitive advantage is that you don’t have to be at your business
                            storefront to operate your retail security system; remote access facilitates camera
                            viewing and management from any Internet-enabled PC or mobile device.
                        </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Scalability: With IP video, you can record, view, and manage all of your cameras at once
                            on the same network without having to worry about managing each unit separately. This
                            allows you to add a camera at any point in time, whether for your current store or a new
                            location.
                            
                        </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Superior Performance: Built-in video intelligence, advanced functions, and improved
                            image quality make network video a smart choice. Analog video cameras unfortunately
                            do not feature megapixel resolution, greatly limiting the quality and detail of every image.
                        </strong></p>
